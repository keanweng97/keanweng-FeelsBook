This android application allows users to record their emotion with one click. The user can pick from one of six emotions (love, joy, surprise, anger, sadness, fear). The application saves the emotion type, current date and the optional comment.

The emotion counts is displayed on the main screen. The application can also show a pop-up with all emotion counts.

The user can browse the history list of recorded emotions, sorted by date. The user can then edit the emotion type, date and comment manually. The user can also delete recorded emotions.
